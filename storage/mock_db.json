Clone or download the repository\n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. The game is ready to run (no external dependencies required)\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the game with:\n\n```bash\npython src/main.py\n```\n\n## Game Instructions\n\n1. The system will generate a random number between 1 and 100\n2. Enter your guess when prompted\n3. The system will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct\n4. Continue guessing until you find the correct number\n5. After completing a game, you can choose to play again or exit\n6. Type 'quit' at any time to exit the current game\n\n## Example Game Session\n\n```\nWelcome to the Number Guessing Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nEnter 'quit' at any time to exit the game.\n\nEnter your guess (1-100) or 'quit' to exit: 50\nToo high!\n\nEnter your guess (1-100) or 'quit' to exit: 25\nToo low!\n\nEnter your guess (1-100) or 'quit' to exit: 37\nToo high!\n\nEnter your guess (1-100) or 'quit' to exit: 31\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 4 attempts.\n\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): no\nThanks for playing!

The specification outlines a straightforward single-player game with clear functional requirements and acceptance criteria.\n\n## Key Research Areas\n\n1. **Language Selection and Frameworks**\n2. **Random Number Generation Libraries**\n3. **Input Validation Patterns**\n4. **User Interface Approaches**\n5. **Game Loop Architecture**\n6. **Error Handling Strategies**\n\n## Findings Summary\n\nThe research indicates that for this type of simple console-based game, standard libraries and straightforward architectural patterns are most appropriate. The requirements don't necessitate complex frameworks or external dependencies, making this an ideal candidate for clean, maintainable code using built-in language features.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Use standard libraries only** - No external dependencies needed for this scope\n2. **Implement MVC pattern** - Separate game logic from user interface\n3. **Choose appropriate language** - Python, JavaScript, or Java based on deployment needs\n4. **Follow defensive programming** - Robust input validation and error handling\n5. **Keep architecture simple** - Single responsibility principle for maintainability",

The player must guess a random integer between 1 and 100, with the game providing feedback on whether each guess is too high, too low, or correct.\n\n## Features\n\n- \ud83c\udfaf **Random Number Generation**: Generates a random integer between 1 and 100 at the start of each game\n- \ud83d\udcdd **Input Validation**: Validates user input to ensure it's a valid integer within the specified range\n- \ud83d\udcac **Real-time Feedback**: Provides immediate feedback on whether the guess is too high, too low, or correct\n- \ud83d\udcca **Attempt Tracking**: Counts and displays the number of guesses made by the user\n- \ud83c\udf89 **Success Display**: Shows a celebratory message with the total number of attempts upon winning\n- \ud83d\udd04 **New Game Option**: Allows users to start a new game after completing the current one\n- \ud83d\udeaa **Graceful Exit**: Users can exit the game at any point by typing 'exit', 'quit', or 'q'\n- \u26a0\ufe0f **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling for invalid inputs with user-friendly messages\n\n## How to Play\n\n1. Run the game using Python 3.6 or higher\n2. The game will generate a random number between 1 and 100\n3. Enter your guess when prompted\n4. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct\n5. Continue guessing until you find the correct number\n6. After winning, choose whether to play again or exit\n\n## Usage\n\n```bash\n# Clone or download the project\n# Navigate to the project directory\npython src/main.py\n```\n\n## Game Commands\n\n- **Numbers 1-100**: Enter your guess\n- **exit/quit/q**: Exit the game at any time\n- **y/yes**: Play again after finishing a game\n- **n/no**: Exit the game after finishing\n\n## Example Game Session\n\n```\n\ud83d\ude80 Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!\n\n====================================================================\n\ud83c\udfaf NUMBER GUESSING GAME\n====================================================================\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nCan you guess what it is?\nType 'exit' at any time to quit the game.\n====================================================================\n\nEnter your guess: 50\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Attempt 1: Too high! Try a lower number.\n\nEnter your guess: 25\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Attempt 2: Too low! Try a higher number.\n\nEnter your guess: 37\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Attempt 3: Too high! Try a lower number.\n\nEnter your guess: 31\n\n\ud83d\udcdd Attempt 4: Correct!\n\n==================================================\n\ud83c\udf89 CONGRATULATIONS! \ud83c\udf89\n==================================================\nYou guessed the number in 4 attempts!\n==================================================\n\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): n\n\nThank you for playing! See you next time! \ud83d\udc4b\n```\n\n## Technical Details\n\n- **Language**: Python 3.6+\n- **Architecture**: Modular design with separate functions for each game component\n- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive validation and error handling throughout\n- **User Experience**: Clean, intuitive interface with clear feedback\n\n## Code Structure\n\n- `generate_random_number()`: Generates the target number\n- `validate_input()`: Validates user input with comprehensive error checking\n- `get_feedback()`: Provides game feedback (too high/too low/correct)\n- `display_success_message()`: Shows the winning message\n- `play_game()`: Main game loop for a single session\n- `main()`: Overall application flow controller\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.6 or higher\n- No external dependencies (uses only Python standard library)\n\n## Installation\n\nNo installation required. Simply run the Python script:\n\n```bash\npython src/main.py\n```\n\n## Contributing\n\nThis is a complete implementation meeting all specified requirements.

Clone or download the repository\n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. The game is ready to run (no external dependencies required)\n\n## Usage\n\nRun the game with:\n\n```bash\npython src/main.py\n```\n\n## Game Instructions\n\n1. The system will generate a random number between 1 and 100\n2. Enter your guess when prompted\n3. The system will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct\n4. Continue guessing until you find the correct number\n5. After completing a game, you can choose to play again or exit\n6. Type 'quit' at any time to exit the current game\n\n## Example Game Session\n\n```\nWelcome to the Number Guessing Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nEnter 'quit' at any time to exit the game.\n\nEnter your guess (1-100) or 'quit' to exit: 50\nToo high!\n\nEnter your guess (1-100) or 'quit' to exit: 25\nToo low!\n\nEnter your guess (1-100) or 'quit' to exit: 37\nToo high!\n\nEnter your guess (1-100) or 'quit' to exit: 31\nCongratulations! You guessed the number in 4 attempts.\n\nDo you want to play again? (yes/no): no\nThanks for playing! Goodbye!\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nRun the test suite with:\n\n```bash\npython run_tests.py\n```\n\n## License\n\nThis project is open source and available under the MIT License.\n"

This game uses only Python's standard library.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Clone or download the repository\n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. Run the game:\n\n```bash\npython src/main.py\n```\n\n## Game Instructions\n\n1. The computer will think of a secret number between 1 and 100\n2. Enter your guess when prompted\n3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct\n4. Keep guessing until you find the secret number\n5. After winning, you can choose to play again or exit\n\n## Controls\n\n- Enter numbers to make guesses\n- Type `exit`, `quit`, or `q` to exit the game\n- Type `yes` or `y` to play again after winning\n- Type `no` or `n` to exit after winning\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.6 or higher\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nnumber-guessing-game/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py          # Main game implementation\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tests/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_game.py     # Unit tests\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nUnit tests are provided in the `tests/` directory.

Process data with streaming updates\n    for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));\n      // Send progress update\n      functionCalling.sendProgress({\n        tool: 'processData',\n        progress: (i + 1) / data.length,\n        message: `Processing item ${i + 1} of ${data.length}`\n      });\n    }\n    return { processed: data.length, result: 'completed' };\n  }\n};\n\n// Register tools\nfunctionCalling.registerTool(streamingTool);\n\n// Set up progress callback\nfunctionCalling.onProgress((progress) => {\n  console.log(`Progress: ${progress.tool} - ${progress.progress * 100}%`);\n});\n\n// Call with streaming\nconst response = await functionCalling.callFunction({\n  prompt: 'Process this data:

This game uses only Python's standard library.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Clone or download the repository\n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. Run the game:\n\n```bash\npython src/main.py\n```\n\n## Game Instructions\n\n1. The computer will think of a secret number between 1 and 100\n2. Enter your guess when prompted\n3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct\n4. Keep guessing until you find the secret number\n5. After winning, you can choose to play again or exit\n\n## Controls\n\n- Enter numbers to make guesses\n- Type `exit`, `quit`, or `q` to exit the game\n- Type `yes` or `y` to play again after winning\n- Type `no` or `n` to exit after winning\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.6 or higher\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nnumber-guessing-game/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py          # Main game implementation\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tests/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_game.py     # Unit tests\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nUnit tests are provided in the `tests/` directory.

Input validation ensures only valid numbers within the range are accepted. The system provides immediate feedback after each guess (too high, too low, or correct). The attempt counter accurately tracks valid guesses. The game ends when the correct number is guessed, displaying a success message with the total attempts. Users can start a new game or exit the application. Invalid inputs are handled gracefully with error messages and do not count as attempts. The code is clean, well-documented, and has passed all tests including edge cases. The application builds successfully and is ready for deployment."

This is a standalone Python script.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Python 3.6 or higher\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Clone or download the repository\n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. Run the game:\n\n```bash\npython src/main.py\n```\n\n## Game Controls\n\n- Enter your guess as a number between 1 and 100\n- Type `exit`, `quit`, or `q` to quit the game at any time\n- After winning, enter `y` to play again or `n` to exit\n\n## Example Game Session\n\n```\nNumber Guessing Game\n====================\n\nWelcome to the Number Guessing Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nCan you guess what it is?\n\nEnter your guess: 50\nToo high! Try a lower number.\n\nEnter your guess: 25\nToo low! Try a higher number.\n\nEnter your guess: 37\nToo high! Try a lower number.\n\nEnter your guess: 31\nCongratulations! You guessed the number 31!\nIt took you 4 attempts.\n\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): n\nThanks for playing! Goodbye!\n```\n\n## Game Flow\n\n1. **Game Initialization**: A random secret number is generated\n2. **User Input**: Player enters a guess\n3. **Input Validation**: System validates the input\n4. **Feedback**: System provides feedback (too high/too low/correct)\n5. **Attempt Tracking**: Number of attempts is tracked and displayed\n6. **Game End**: Game ends when number is guessed correctly\n7. **New Game Option**: Player can choose to play again or exit\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe game handles various error scenarios gracefully:\n\n- **Invalid Input**: Non-numeric input shows error message and prompts again\n- **Out of Range**: Numbers outside 1-100 show appropriate error message\n- **Keyboard Interrupt**: Ctrl+C exits gracefully with thank you message\n- **EOF Error**: Handles end-of-file scenarios (like Ctrl+D)\n\n## Code Structure\n\n- `NumberGuessingGame` class: Main game logic and state management\n- `generate_secret_number()`: Creates new random number for each game\n- `validate_guess()`: Ensures input is valid and within range\n- `check_guess()`: Compares guess to secret number and provides feedback\n- `play_round()`: Manages a single game session\n- `ask_for_new_game()`: Handles post-game options\n- `run()`: Main game loop for multiple sessions\n\n## Testing\n\nThe game has been tested with various scenarios including:\n\n- Valid guesses within range\n- Invalid input (non-numeric)\n- Out-of-range numbers\n- Game completion\n- Multiple game sessions\n- Exit scenarios\n- Edge cases and error conditions\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to submit issues and enhancement requests!\n\n## License\n\nThis project is open source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nPotential improvements for future versions:\n\n- Difficulty levels (different ranges)\n- High score tracking\n- Hint system\n- GUI version\n- Multiplayer mode\n- Statistics and analytics\n\n## Support\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please create an issue in the repository.\n"

This game uses only Python's standard library.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Clone or download the repository\n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. Run the game:\n\n```bash\npython src/main.py\n```\n\n## Game Instructions\n\n1. The computer will think of a secret number between 1 and 100\n2. Enter your guess when prompted\n3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct\n4. Keep guessing until you find the secret number\n5. After winning, you can choose to play again or exit\n\n## Controls\n\n- Enter numbers to make guesses\n- Type `exit`, `quit`, or `q` to exit the game\n- Type `yes` or `y` to play again after winning\n- Type `no` or `n` to exit after winning\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.6 or higher\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nnumber-guessing-game/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py          # Main game implementation\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tests/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_game.py     # Unit tests\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nUnit tests are provided in the `tests/` directory.

Process data with streaming updates\n    for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));\n      // Send progress update\n      functionCalling.sendProgress({\n        tool: 'processData',\n        progress: (i + 1) / data.length,\n        message: `Processing item ${i + 1} of ${data.length}`\n      });\n    }\n    return { processed: data.length, result: 'completed' };\n  }\n};\n\n// Register tools\nfunctionCalling.registerTool(streamingTool);\n\n// Set up progress callback\nfunctionCalling.onProgress((progress) => {\n  console.log(`Progress: ${progress.tool} - ${progress.progress * 100}%`);\n});\n\n// Call with streaming\nconst response = await functionCalling.callFunction({\n  prompt: 'Process this data:

The specification outlines a straightforward single-player game with clear functional requirements and acceptance criteria.\n\n## Key Research Areas\n\n1. **Language Selection and Frameworks**\n2. **Random Number Generation Libraries**\n3. **Input Validation Patterns**\n4. **User Interface Approaches**\n5. **Game Loop Architecture**\n6. **Error Handling Strategies**\n\n## Findings Summary\n\nThe research indicates that for this type of simple console-based game, standard libraries and straightforward architectural patterns are most appropriate. The requirements don't necessitate complex frameworks or external dependencies, making this an ideal candidate for clean, maintainable code using built-in language features.\n\n## Recommendations\n\n1. **Use standard libraries only** - No external dependencies needed for this scope\n2. **Implement MVC pattern** - Separate game logic from user interface\n3. **Choose appropriate language** - Python, JavaScript, or Java based on deployment needs\n4. **Follow defensive programming** - Robust input validation and error handling\n5. **Keep architecture simple** - Single responsibility principle for maintainability",

The analysis covered multiple technology stacks including web, desktop, and mobile platforms.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- For web-based implementations, vanilla JavaScript with HTML/CSS provides the simplest and most performant solution\n- Desktop applications can leverage Electron for cross-platform support or native frameworks like PyQt/PySide for Python\n- Mobile implementations work well with React Native or native iOS/Android frameworks\n- The game logic is straightforward and doesn't require complex frameworks, making it ideal for learning and rapid development\n\n**Architecture Recommendations:**\n- Use a simple MVC or component-based architecture to separate game logic from UI\n- Implement state management to track game state, attempts, and validation\n- Follow clean code principles with proper separation of concerns\n\nThe requirements are well-defined and achievable with minimal dependencies across all major platforms.",

The requirements don't justify the complexity overhead of modern frameworks. However, if building a more complex application, React with hooks provides excellent state management. For desktop, Electron allows web technologies to create cross-platform applications, while PyQt/PySide offers native Python desktop development."

The attempt counter accurately tracks valid guesses. The game ends when the correct number is guessed, displaying a success message with the total attempts. Users can start a new game or exit the application. Invalid inputs are handled gracefully with error messages and do not count as attempts.

              "content": "# Number Guessing Game\n\nA simple and fun command-line number guessing game built in Python.\n\n## Game Description\n\nThe Number Guessing Game is a classic guessing game where:\n- The computer generates a random secret number between 1 and 100\n- The player tries to guess the number\n- After each guess, the player receives feedback (too high, too low, or correct)\n- The game tracks the number of attempts\n- Players can play multiple rounds or exit at any time\n\n## Features\n\n- \u2705 Random number generation within a configurable range\n- \u2705 Input validation with user-friendly error messages\n- \u2705 Real-time feedback for each guess\n- \u2705 Attempt counter to track progress\n- \u2705 Multiple game sessions support\n- \u2705 Graceful handling of invalid inputs\n- \u2705 Clean, intuitive command-line interface\n- \u2705 Exit functionality with proper cleanup\n\n## Installation\n\nNo installation required! This is a standalone Python script.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- Python 3.6 or higher\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Clone or download the repository\n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. Run the game:\n\n```bash\npython src/main.py\n```\n\n## Game Controls\n\n- Enter your guess as a number between 1 and 100\n- Type `exit`, `quit`, or `q` to quit the game at any time\n- After winning, enter `y` to play again or `n` to exit\n\n## Example Game Session\n\n```\nNumber Guessing Game\n====================\n\nWelcome to the Number Guessing Game!\nI'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.\nCan you guess what it is?\n\nEnter your guess: 50\nToo high! Try a lower number.\n\nEnter your guess: 25\nToo low! Try a higher number.\n\nEnter your guess: 37\nToo high! Try a lower number.\n\nEnter your guess: 31\nCongratulations! You guessed the number 31!\nIt took you 4 attempts.\n\nDo you want to play again? (y/n): n\nThanks for playing! Goodbye!\n```\n\n## Game Flow\n\n1. **Game Initialization**: A random secret number is generated\n2. **User Input**: Player enters a guess\n3. **Input Validation**: System validates the input\n4. **Feedback**: System provides feedback (too high/too low/correct)\n5. **Attempt Tracking**: Number of attempts is tracked and displayed\n6. **Game End**: Game ends when number is guessed correctly\n7. **New Game Option**: Player can choose to play again or exit\n\n## Error Handling\n\nThe game handles various error scenarios gracefully:\n\n- **Invalid Input**: Non-numeric input shows error message and prompts again\n- **Out of Range**: Numbers outside 1-100 show appropriate error message\n- **Keyboard Interrupt**: Ctrl+C exits gracefully with thank you message\n- **EOF Error**: Handles end-of-file scenarios (like Ctrl+D)\n\n## Code Structure\n\n- `NumberGuessingGame` class: Main game logic and state management\n- `generate_secret_number()`: Creates new random number for each game\n- `validate_guess()`: Ensures input is valid and within range\n- `check_guess()`: Compares guess to secret number and provides feedback\n- `play_round()`: Manages a single game session\n- `ask_for_new_game()`: Handles post-game options\n- `run()`: Main game loop for multiple sessions\n\n## Testing\n\nThe game has been tested with various scenarios including:\n\n- Valid guesses within range\n- Invalid input (non-numeric)\n- Out-of-range numbers\n- Game completion\n- Multiple game sessions\n- Exit scenarios\n- Edge cases and error conditions\n\n## Contributing\n\nFeel free to submit issues and enhancement requests!\n\n## License\n\nThis project is open source and available under the [MIT License](LICENSE).\n\n## Future Enhancements\n\nPotential improvements for future versions:\n\n- Difficulty levels (different ranges)\n- High score tracking\n- Hint system\n- GUI version\n- Multiplayer mode\n- Statistics and analytics\n\n## Support\n\nIf you encounter any issues or have suggestions, please create an issue in the repository.\n"

This game uses only Python's standard library.\n\n## Usage\n\n1. Clone or download the repository\n2. Navigate to the project directory\n3. Run the game:\n\n```bash\npython src/main.py\n```\n\n## Game Instructions\n\n1. The computer will think of a secret number between 1 and 100\n2. Enter your guess when prompted\n3. The game will tell you if your guess is too high, too low, or correct\n4. Keep guessing until you find the secret number\n5. After winning, you can choose to play again or exit\n\n## Controls\n\n- Enter numbers to make guesses\n- Type `exit`, `quit`, or `q` to exit the game\n- Type `yes` or `y` to play again after winning\n- Type `no` or `n` to exit after winning\n\n## Requirements\n\n- Python 3.6 or higher\n\n## Project Structure\n\n```\nnumber-guessing-game/\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py          # Main game implementation\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 tests/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 test_game.py     # Unit tests\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 README.md\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 setup.py\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 LICENSE\n```\n\n## Testing\n\nUnit tests are provided in the `tests/` directory.

Process data with streaming updates\n    for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {\n      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 100));\n      // Send progress update\n      functionCalling.sendProgress({\n        tool: 'processData',\n        progress: (i + 1) / data.length,\n        message: `Processing item ${i + 1} of ${data.length}`\n      });\n    }\n    return { processed: data.length, result: 'completed' };\n  }\n};\n\n// Register tools\nfunctionCalling.registerTool(streamingTool);\n\n// Set up progress callback\nfunctionCalling.onProgress((progress) => {\n  console.log(`Progress: ${progress.tool} - ${progress.progress * 100}%`);\n});\n\n// Call with streaming\nconst response = await functionCalling.callFunction({\n  prompt: 'Process this data: [\"item1\", \"item2\", \"item3\"]',\n  tools: ['processData'],\n  streaming: true\n});\n\nconsole.log(response);\n```\n\n## Usage\n\n### Configuration Options\n\n```typescript\ninterface

The research confirms that modern browsers provide all necessary APIs for DOM manipulation, CSS styling, and game loop management through `requestAnimationFrame`.\n\n**Key Findings:**\n- Vanilla JavaScript is sufficient for all functional requirements\n- CSS Grid or absolute positioning works well for the game board\n- Keyboard event handling provides responsive controls\n- Canvas API offers better performance for complex rendering\n- Local Storage can handle high scores if needed\n\n**Implementation Approach:**\nThe game can be efficiently built using a grid-based system with either DOM elements or Canvas API. The core game loop, collision detection, and state management can all be handled with vanilla JavaScript, meeting all functional and non-functional requirements without external dependencies.",
